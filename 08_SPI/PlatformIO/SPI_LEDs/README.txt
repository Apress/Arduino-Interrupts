SPI_LEDs

This sketch uses SPI to send data to a Texas Instruments SN74HC595 shift register. Once all 8 bits of data have arrived, the shift register will copy the data onto its output pins, lighting up a set of eight LEDs. 

The Arduino UNO in the sketch is configured as an SPI controller.

There is a Fritzing project showing the breadboard layout. 

In case you don't have Fritzing, there is a PNG file showing the breadboard layout as well.
