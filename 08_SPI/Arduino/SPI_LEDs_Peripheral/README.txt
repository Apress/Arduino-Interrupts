SPI_LEDs

This sketch uses uses, in my case, an Arduino Duemilanove as an SPI controller, and an UNO configured as an SPI peripheral device. 

The UNO will, optionally, copy all data received over SPI to the Serial Monitor and also, to 8 LEDs attached to pins D0-D7.

The Arduino UNO in the sketch is configured as an SPI controller.

There is a Fritzing project showing the breadboard layout. 

In case you don't have Fritzing, there is a PNG file showing the breadboard layout as well.
