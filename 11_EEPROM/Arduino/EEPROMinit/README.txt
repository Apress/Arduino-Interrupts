EEPROMinit

This sketch simply writes the required data to the 
EEPROM. The loop() function here reads the data back and displays it, but 
that just shows that the data were written correctly. This sketch is 
intended to be used once to initialise data in the EEPROM, then further 
sketches can be uploaded to read and use the EEPROM data.
