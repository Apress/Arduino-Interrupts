EEPROMinterrupt: 

An AVR application to read and write to/from the EEPROM under interrupt control. The data read from the EEPROM is written to the USART which is itself under interrupt control - two sets of interrupts for the price of one! This is an AVR C++ conversion of the Arduino EEPROMinterrupt.ino sketch.
