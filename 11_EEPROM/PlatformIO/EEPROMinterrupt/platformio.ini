;--------------------------------------------------------------
; Where to find my various PlatformIO libraries. This is a
; relative path from the project directory to the directory
; named "PlatformIO.libraries" under which, each library is
; to be found in it's own sub-directory.
;
; In each subdirectory is the source and header files. There's
; no need for "lib_deps" in this case.
;
; Doing this here saves having multiple copies of the library
; coe in each and every project that needs them. One copy only.
