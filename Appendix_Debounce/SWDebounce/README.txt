SWDebounce

This sketch uses RC (resistor-Capacitor) debouncing as explained in the Appendix. This creates a delay in the Arduino pin seeing the state of the pin when a buttom/switch is attached to it, which bounces. 

The book explains how the resistor and capcitor values can be changed to adjust the timing constant of the circuit, leading to better debouncing.
