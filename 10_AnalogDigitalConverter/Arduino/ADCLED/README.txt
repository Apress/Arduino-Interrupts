ADCLED

This sketch uses the ADC in free running mode to repeatedly read the value from a potentiometer attached to pin A0. The value is adjusted to be between 0 and 255, rather than 0 and 1023, and written to PWM pin D9 to dim and brighten the LED based on the setting of the potentiometer.

There is a Fritzing project showing the breadboard layout. 

In case you don't have Fritzing, there is a PNG file showing the breadboard layout as well.
