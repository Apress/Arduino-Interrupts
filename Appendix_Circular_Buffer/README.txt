Circular Buffers

The code in this directory illustrate a generic circular buffer system which can be used on em bedded microcontrollers with minimum change. 

Circular buffers are used, in the book, in the USART chapter when discussing PlatformIO code -- the Arduino uses them internally but doesn't tell you about this!

An example sketch is provided to read, write and error out when accessing these buffers.
