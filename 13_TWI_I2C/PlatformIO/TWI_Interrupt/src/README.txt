The two USART*.cpp files in 'src' plus the two USART*.h
files in the 'include' directory are copies of files taken
from Chapter 9, the USART chapter.

These 4 files *might* be a little out of date if I've made
any changes in Chapter 9. For best results, copy the 4 files
from Chapter 9 to here before comipling and running the code.

This way, you are guaranteed to get the latest version.
