The Fritzing project and the image file in this parent directory contain the breadboard layout for all the projects in the Arduino and PlatformIO subdirectories. The same setup is used throughout, unless the book says otherwise!

Putting the project and image files here saves duplicating them in each project for no apparent gain.
