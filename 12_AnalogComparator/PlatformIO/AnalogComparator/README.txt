AnalogComparator

This sketch uses the Analog comparator interrupt to light 
an LED on pin PB0 when the ACO bit toggles.

The main loop will be flashing a red LED at 5 second intervals.


There is a Fritzing project showing the breadboard layout. 

In case you don't have Fritzing, there is a PNG file showing the breadboard layout as well.
