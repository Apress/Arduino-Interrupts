Timer1CompBlink

This sketch uses Timer1's Compare Match interrupts to toggle LEDs on pins PB0 and PB1 every second. The built in LED flashes every 5 seconds while those on PB0/PB1 flash every second, approximately.

There is a Fritzing project showing the breadboard layout. 

In case you don't have Fritzing, there is a PNG file showing the breadboard layout as well.
